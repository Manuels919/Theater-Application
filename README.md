# Theater Application

The Theater Application sells tickets to a theater show. The theater has 4 rows: A, B, C, and D, where each row has 8 seats. The tickets in row A cost $32, $28 in row B, and $24 in row C and D. The user is able to view the available seats and purchase them but entering in their full name and pressing the "sell" button. The names that are entered are then saved to a text file, which can be saved.
